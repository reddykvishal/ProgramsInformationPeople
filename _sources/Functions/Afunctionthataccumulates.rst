A function that accumulates
---------------------------

We have used the ``len`` function a lot already. If it weren't part of python,
our lives as programmers would have been a lot harder.

Well, actually, not that much harder. Now that we know how to define functions, we could define
``len`` ourselves if it did not exist. Previously, we have used the accumlator 
pattern to count the number of lines in a file. Let's use that same idea and 
just wrap it in a function definition. We'll call it ``mylen`` to distinguish it
from the real ``len`` which already exists. We actually *could* call it len, but
that wouldn't be a very good idea, because it would replace the original len function,
and our implementation may not be a very good one.

.. activecode:: functions_6

   def mylen(x):
       c = 0 # initialize count variable to 0
       for y in x:
           c = c + 1   # increment the counter for each item in x
       return c
      
   print mylen("hello")
   print mylen([1, 2, 7])

   Rearrange the code statements to match the activecode window above. (This is an exercise in noticing where the indenting and outdenting happens, and where the return statement goes.)
